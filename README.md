# Pneumonia X-Rays of Human Lungs AI Project
Welcome to the Pneumonia X-Rays of Human Lungs AI Project! This project focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze X-ray images of human lungs and detect the presence of pneumonia. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more accurately and efficiently.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI model capable of accurately identifying pneumonia in X-ray images of human lungs. By training the model on a dataset of labeled X-ray images, the goal is to create a reliable tool that can assist radiologists and healthcare providers in diagnosing pneumonia cases.

## Features
1. **X-Ray Image Analysis:** Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze X-ray images and identify features indicative of pneumonia.

2. **Model Training:** Trains the AI model on a labeled dataset of X-ray images, using techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation to improve performance.

3. **Prediction:** Provides the capability to input new X-ray images into the trained model and receive predictions regarding the presence or absence of pneumonia.

4. **Accuracy Evaluation:** Assesses the accuracy of the AI model by comparing its predictions with ground truth labels from the dataset.

5. **User Interface (Optional):** Optionally, includes a user interface (UI) for interacting with the AI model, uploading X-ray images, and viewing predictions.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Pneumonia-X-Rays-of-Human-Lungs-AI-project

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies by following the instructions provided in the project documentation or README file.

4. **Download Dataset (Optional):** If necessary, download the dataset of labeled X-ray images and place it in the appropriate directory within the project structure.

5. **Train the Model:** Train the AI model using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.

6. **Test and Evaluate:** Test the trained model using test data and evaluate its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. **Run the User Interface (Optional):** If a user interface is included, start the UI application and interact with the AI model through the interface.

## Usage
1. **Upload X-Ray Images:** If a user interface is available, upload X-ray images of human lungs to the application for analysis.

2. **View Predictions:** Receive predictions from the AI model regarding the presence or absence of pneumonia in the uploaded X-ray images.

3. **Evaluate Accuracy:** Assess the accuracy of the AI model by comparing its predictions with ground truth labels from the dataset.

4. **Fine-Tune Model (Optional):** Optionally, fine-tune the AI model using additional data or adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.
